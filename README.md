*Selection Sort Summary
The big O notation of selection sort is 0(n^2), thus unlike the merge sort and quick sort , the runtime of this algorithm is longer .
In my test, I considered all the 0(1) and 0(n^2) operations and generalized a formula to compute the running time of selection sort
* Quick Sort Summary 
The big 0 notation of quick sort is generally in its best case is O(nlogn) and worst case is 0(n^2).
From my test results, i found that generally the big o notation of quick sort and merge sort is the same but what differs is the number of
comparisons of quicksort is less than that of merge sort. In my test , i generalized the formula to determine the runtime of quicksort in the best case
* Merge Sort Summary
The big O notation of merge sort is generally 0(nlogn). Merge sort divides the array into halfs, sorts the sublist into single elements and merges the sublist to get a sorted list. 
In my test I found that because of this, the number of comparisons of merge sort is larger than that of quick sort. But in terms of the runtime , i found that
quick sort and merge sort have the same big 0 notation in the best case.
